# 📁 Scripts
This repository contains a collection of scripts gathered and created by me for various purposes.

## 🧠 About
Over the years, I've worked with all sorts of `technologies` and situations where I needed fast and efficient `scripts`. Instead of keeping them scattered across folders, I gathered them into a `repo` to make them easier to access, reuse, and **improve**.
This repo is useful for:
- developers
- system administrators
- scripting enthusiasts
- anyone who wants to `automate`  repetitive tasks

## 📂 What do you find here?
You will find scripts written in several languages, including:
- CPP
- Python
- JS
- That's it for a while)

## 🎱 How is it used?
Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ValyMnDul/Scripts.git
```
Go to the scripts folder
```bash
cd Scripts/Scripts
```
Choose programming language
```bash
cd <language>   #Replace <language> with the language of your choice
```
Choose your script and use it!   


## ☕ How do I run each script based on the extension?
**NOTE:** Some commands may be slightly different on `Windows`.
- CPP (C++)
```bash
g++ -o program <script.cpp>   #compiling
./program   #executing
```
- Python
```bash
python3 <script.py>
```
- JS
  - If it works with `node`:
  ```bash
  node <script.js>
  ```

  - If it works with the `browser` just add it to the `index`:
  ```html
  <script src="<script.js>"></script>  <!-- Replace "<script.js>" with the path to script.js -->
  ```
